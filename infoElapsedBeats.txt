    Same with keyboard_Cold_Blood_-_Baby_I_Love_You.ogg
    Same with bass_Nights_Creatures_-_Thats_the_night.ogg
    Same with Fr-grenouille.ogg

    Yet the website http://aubio.org/news works fine with those audio files.
    I created this issue https://github.com/piem/aubio/issues/13

    Second meeting at Panara Bread Thu 11 Sep 2014 10 AM CST, Devi, Nihar, Dale.
    Devi - is it doable.
    Nihar - 2 use cases; demo show it Elapsed Beats (EB) use.

    try python2 at install? Nope, bubbles gets to the same failure.
